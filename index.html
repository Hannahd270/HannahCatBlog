<article class="below"><p>Some of the best parts of a family outing are the memories of exploring nature with my family.I recently added a new member to my family named Usagi. Usagi is an adorable cat I rescued and immediately fell in love with. So, when my family decided to plan a camping trip in the hill country I began my journey of finding the best cat backpack for this adventure. I knew Usagi would be hiking and exploring the outdoors with the rest of our family, so a cat backpack would be a must.</p>
		<p>I wanted Usagi to have the best experience for our first adventure. When I started researching cat backpacks, I wanted to be sure that they were cat tested and approved. I knew it had to have comfort, good ventilation and be calming for Usagi. I found a site that had 6 best backpacks for traveling cats tested by cats, The 6 Best Backpack Cat Carriers of 2024, Tested and Reviewed <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/best-backpack-cat-carriers-5225260">thesprucepets.com.</a> This site also tested the same features that were important to me.
</p>
		<p> I got to thinking after reviewing everything I wanted for Usagi, that I too, would need comfort since I would be carrying her on the hike.I wanted to make sure that we both had comfort and I wouldn’t have to struggle towards the end of our adventure. I came across, “ Best Cat Backpack (2024) - 14 Urban Or Hiking Cat Carrier Options <a href="https://welovecatsandkittens.com/cat-supplies/cat-backpack/">welovecatsandkittens.com”.</a> This site showed me different reviews from cat owners who hike. I found in the reviews that they all shared the same features that are important to me.
</p>
		<p>By figuring out what features were not only important for Usagi but also for me, I was able to choose the best cat backpack for our first family camping trip. I chose one that has a clear dome on the front for her to see all her surroundings, while allowing more space for comfort and to keep her calm. The mesh side and the holes at the bottom of the dome allow for great ventilation. The backpack style with adjustable straps allows comfort for me on the hike. Now Usagi and I are ready to start creating family memories.
